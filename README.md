# ImagePickerWeb

This Web-Plugin allows Flutter Web to pick images (as Widget or Uint8List) and videos (as Uint8List).

### Disclaimer for Videos
* Till now [Feb. 2020] it's not possible (due to security reasons) to load a local video file (see also video_player_web). But you can retreive the bytes and upload them somewhere and play it as a network source.

## Getting Started

Add ```image_picker_web``` to your pubspec.yaml:

```yaml
    image_picker_web: any
```
